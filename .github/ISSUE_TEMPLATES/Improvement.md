Scope

AN IMPROVEMENT REQUEST INTENDS TO IMPROVE A CERTAIN ALREADY IMPLEMENTED FEATURE E.G. BY RESTRUCTURING THE CODE, MAKING IT MORE READABLE OR USING DIFFERENT METHODS TO ACHIEVE THE VERY SAME BEHAVIOUR.
THE DIFFERENCE TO A FEATURE REQUEST IS THAT AN IMPROVEMENT DOES NOT ALTER EXISTING BEHAVIOUR AND IN PARTICULAR DOES NOT IMPLEMENT A NEW FUNCTIONALITY.
