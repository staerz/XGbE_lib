## Directory content

### Doxyfile_local
It is a project-specific Doxygen configuration file, included by the main Doxygen configuration file.

Minimal expected parameters to set here are `INPUT` and `PROJECT_NAME`.

### Makefile
Makefile to start Doxygen and run the creation of the manual.

It sets the component name and includes the [main Doxygen Makefile](./config/#makefile).
